                               -----This is a read me file that explains the program and how to run the program-----
												 
First to create this Network program I used a library called Kryonet, it is a networking library, I found that it makes the programming more
simple. I used this site: http://code.google.com/p/kryonet/ on the site I downloaded the package from GitHub: https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet
. This gave all the library files after I set everything up on eclipse by starting a new project and adding the necassary libraries. It showed it on 
GitHub how to connect to a Server etc.

How to Run the program: 

1).RUN the Server first: Main.java (under Assignment)
2).RUN the Client: Main.java (under Client)
3).ENTER a username the client who started is the admin client
4).CLICK on run again under the client this allows another user to join and you can repeat this
5).if you click on the first GUI it shows the admin client and a list of all the users online
6). SEND messages from any particular user that has joined
